# gruv-firefox
This is my fork of daaniieel's nord-firefox theme, I just adjusted the palette to match the gruvbox colorscheme.

# nord-firefox
My firefox userChrome.css theme, based on https://github.com/AnubisZ9/Global-Dark-Nordic-theme/.

### Additions / Features
* tabs are over the title bar
* tidied the thing up
* uses the Nord color scheme instead of Nordic-Dark
* no issues on normal density
* made tabs bigger
* URL PopUp background matches everything else

Thanks to the people over at reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS!

### Please use one of those themes with this or the URL bar will look odd on Firefox 75+
* NordGTK
* Nordic (doesn't look that nice)
* Arc-Dark
